# Fine-tune with Hugging Face

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a model using full pathology images with integrated image tiling for efficient model training and validation.

## Image Tiling for Full Pathology Images
- **Image Tiling**: The pathology images are divided into smaller tiles for better training and validation performance.

## Model Training Across Tiled Images
- **Training**: The model is trained using the tiled images to enhance feature extraction and learning.
- **Training Parameters**: Specify the model architecture, learning rate, and other hyperparameters.

## Validation Against Whole-Slide Predictions
- **Validation**: Use whole-slide predictions to assess the model's performance across the entire image set.
- **Metrics**: Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
Run the subsequent cells to start the training and validation process on the dataset.

## Conclusion
The integration of image tiling and validation strategies significantly improves model performance in pathology image analysis.
